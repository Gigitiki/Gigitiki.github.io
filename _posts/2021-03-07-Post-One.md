**When We Ask for Women's voices in History, What are We Asking?**

*Preface*

I am against the say of "rescuing women from history", so long as we interpret 'history' as 'historigaphies that summarise our past and create history and nonhistory in the life of our human society'. 
Under traidtional historigraphies, history is about the productive units, being either a family, a commune, or lately a male individual; history is about the units of power, being a King, a Queen, a Government, a successful Revolutionary or a God.
It will only be reasonable for people to not find any voice of women, as well as the voice of the commons, in this sort of historiography. 

*And you may argue, that kind of historiography has long gone. You will quote the history of the female factory workers, history of female office workers, female education, female businesses, female careworkers, female artists, female activists to stress your points.*

I will say that these writings do little to challenge the audience to think, 
1) Why we are having a world with women filling in the unskilled and low-to-middle-ranked office jobs, and 
2) Whether these jobs are the only ways for women to be productive for the society, and
3) In what sense are women empowered by these social changes to defend their voices in the society. 

The many historiograohies out there are absuing the power of words to portray women-in-work, women-making-business, and women-going-to-street as proof of women's achievement to make voices in history, masterly skipping the point that women being not making money, women being not making business, and women being not on the street should blame themselves for not having a voice in history at all. 

On the contrary, if we recognize that women's lives are a natural part of historiography no matter how they go, we will get to the back of these historical narratives and stop blaming ourselves (our woman selves) for not recognizing our voices in the "history": How could we rescue a thing that has not existed?
