*What is this site for?*

This site serves to record the thoughts I had on the reality I am situated in -- and the one I has contributed to without great awareness. I am not a great writer in a sense that you see no solid ground to treat me as an intellectual or a trustworthy person (one should trust his own judgement the most anyway). This is to say, for you to read my post, I rely on your reason to recognize how my writings resonate with your personal and greater interests. 

*Why spilling?*

The idea of open blogging came at the time when I found that no one was interested at deep serious thoughts in private social circles. In the meantime I was caught up between the political currents and could not register my voice with either of the sides. I have grown uncomfortable at how social events or individuals are framed to get away things I concern. 


*Disclaimer of Interest?*

The posts may be heavily embedded with disciplinary knowledge of History and Sociology. The writer 'me' is most productive when fuelled with emotions. Thence, when you see an update, check the weather.
